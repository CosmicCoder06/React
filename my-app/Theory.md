React is a decleraative, component based, state-driven javascript library for building ui.

## component-based:-
ocompponent are basic building blocks of ui in react, we build complex ui by building and combining multiple components.

## Declerative:-
We define how the compnents looks like and how it will works using jsx.
We tell react see based on this state the components looks like this.
We never touch DOM directly in react.
## State-Driven is similar to this

## JSX:-
It is a declerative syntax to describe how the component looks like and how it works.
Each component must return a block of jsx.
JSX is an extension of javascript that allows us to embed js, css, and react components into html.
jsx is converted to javascript automatically with the help of a tool named as "BABEL".

## props:-
Props are use to pass data from parent component to child component (down the component tree), It is an essential tool to configure and costumize component it is with the help of props parent components control how child component look like and work. We can pass anything in a prop single values, arrays, values, functions, even other objects.
